# Qohelet
Qohelet is a fully responsive theme for Wordpress. It has been built on the shoulders of giants, utilizing a number of other technologies, such as: 1. The Quark starter theme by Anthony Horton. 2. Quark is in turn built upon Underscores by Automattix. 3. Quark utilizes Normalize, Modernizr and Options Framework. 4. I have replaced Options Framework with the Redux Framework. 5. Qohelet also features a slider, based on Flexislide. 6. Many other smaller amounts of other technologies have been incorporated, so that I did not re-invent the wheel.

## Version 0.2
The Redux Framework has been added, and some adjustments made. However, the Options Framework has not yet been removed, as it is deeply embedded, and requires some special (of_get_option) functions to be removed or edited.
